        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  ***This paper is about data tidying and how it is one of the most important aspects of data analysis. The specific structure of a tidy dataset is each variable is acolumn, each observation a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. Principles of tidy data provide standard ways to organise data values within a dataset.***\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  ***It is intended to make initial data cleaning easier because you don't have to start from scratch/reinvent the wheel each time. It is designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data and to simplify development of data analysis tools that worktogether.***\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "  ***The first sentence means that tidy datasets follow a similar structure that allows for ease of analysis, while messy datasets are all uniquely messy and may have very different things wrong with them. The second sentence means that that it is intuitive to understand what a \"dataframe/matrix\" is made of but that it is harder to fully define what each variable and observation is and this can lead to uninitentional bad choices about cleaning and data organization.***\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  *** A dataset is a collection of values which are numeric or categorical/strings. Every value belogns to both a variable and an observaiton. A variable is a collection of values that measure the same attribute or property and an observation is a collection of values that measure it.***\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  ***Each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. If data is not tidy, it is messy***\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "  ***5 Most common problems with messy datasets: 1) Column headers are values, not variable names. 2) Multiple variables are stored in one column. 3) Variables are stored in both rows and columns. 4) Mulitple types of observational units are stored in the same table. 5) A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. Table 4 is messy becaues the columns are really values of a \"hidden\" variable, which is income. Since income is actually a variable, you need a new column, income, alongside religion, and then frequency, as in table 6. Now, the columns are all the names of variables, rather than the values that variables take. Melting a dataset is this process of converting column-value variables into rows.***\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  ***Table 11 has days along the top, which are values. Table 12 melts those days into a single variable, date. That still isn't tidy, because the element variable contains variable names and not values --- tmax and tmin are measurements of the same day, which are really names of variables and not values themselves. Table 12(b) is tidy because all the entries are attributes and not variable names.***\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  ***If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. This makes it easy to get stuck in a local maxima where independently changing datat structures or data tools will not improve workflow. Wickham hopes that others will build on this framework to develop even better data stroage strategies and better tools.***"
